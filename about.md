About the blog :

You'll find here my discovers and devs about technologies I use / optimize / develop.
About "cyber" security, and useful stuffs to make life simpler.


About me :

Curious by nature, I want to try things I find interesting. As every programmer / engineer, I like handy, simple and mainly free stuffs.
I think that IT must stay for the enhancement of humans and it must be fun ! Otherwise we should do something else.
So you can now try passwords like nature123 or p34c347h3W0rlD_ to get my social media accounts ;)
Else I enjoy sharing my knowledge and sometimes I get paid for it !
Je parle aussi français y español :)
