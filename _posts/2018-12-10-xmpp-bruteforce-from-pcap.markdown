Hello world,

Today I'll share a way to bruteforce an xmpp authentication from a pcap file of the capture.

Check out the [repository][repo] for now, everything's explained, I'll update the post later to add screenshots and so on.

Possible improvements : dev the parts of capture straight from the pcap.
